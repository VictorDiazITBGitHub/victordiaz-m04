    <P class="narrator">3rd of December <br>07:44 AM, rainy</P>
    <br><br>
    <p class="narrator">Is it morning yet?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">Car engine roars, almost muttering.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">He is back in town.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">Of body, yet not of memory.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">...</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">08:04 AM, local police office</p>
    <p class="narrator">His place of work?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">Just as he gets within knob's reach, the door opens in front of him.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Aslan, his subordinate, waits up ahead, coffe in-hand.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="aslan">Ye'r late, boss.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">Almost magnetically, he says, humorously:</p>
    <br>
    <p class="cynth">-Go get me a coffe.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="aslan">(Scratches his head) ...Sure.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="narrator">He, wondering why he only saw one worker out of the whole team, simply leaves it be and heads
        into his desk's over-fancy armchair, sitting down as if the world weighed upon his shoulders.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Leaning his head to the side to rest his head he makes sight of a slightly misplaced file among
        the sea of notes.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="narrator">Should we open the door...?</p>
